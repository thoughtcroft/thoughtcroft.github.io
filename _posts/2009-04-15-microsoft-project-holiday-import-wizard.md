Check out this [VBA enabled Microsoft Project
Plan](http://www.thoughtcroft.com/downloads/project-holiday-import-wizard)
document that I recently developed. It neatly solves a need of every
project manager who uses Microsoft Project to track their project:
**marking public holidays as non-working time in the project schedule**.

My approach is to use the Outlook Holiday File that is installed on your
computer when you install Microsoft Office Outlook. It contains hundreds
of religious and national holidays from countries around the world. If
you don't have Outlook installed, the wizard will take you to a page
where you can learn about this file and download a copy to use as a
source of holiday dates.

Best of all: its free!
