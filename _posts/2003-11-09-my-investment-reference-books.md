I've been consuming books like crazy to get ourselves ready for managing
our super (and as a consequence of starting an Investment Partnership in
late 2001 with Caroline and 13 other people now down to 12 in total).

These include:

* [Do It Yourself Superannuation](http://www.bookdepository.com/DIY-Superannuation-Austin-Donnelly/9780701636906) by Austin Donnelly and Barbara Smith (4th Edition)
* [Guide To Self Managed Super Funds](http://www.bookdepository.com/Guide-Self-Managed-Super-Funds-Grant-Abbott/9781864686388?ref=grid-view) by Grant Abbott
* [The Intelligent Investor](http://www.bookdepository.com/The-Intelligent-Investor-Benjamin-Graham/9780060155476?ref=grid-view) by Benjamin Graham
* [Security Analysis](http://www.bookdepository.com/Security-Analysis-Benjamin-Graham-David-Dodd/9780070244962?ref=grid-view) by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd
* [A Wonderful Company At A Fair Price](http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/998669) by Brian McNiven
* [Borrowing To Invest](http://www.bookdepository.com/Borrowing-Invest-Noel-Whittaker-Paul-Resnik/9780731811724?ref=grid-view) by Noel Whittaker and Paul Resnik
* [The Intelligent Investors Guide to Share Buying](http://www.bookdepository.com/The-Intelligent-Investors-Guide-Share-Buying-Tim-Hewat/9780701636746?ref=grid-view) by Tim Hewat
* [The Warren Buffett Way](http://www.bookdepository.com/The-Warren-Buffett-Way-Robert-G-Hagstrom/9780471177500?ref=grid-view) by Robert G Hagstrom
* [The Warren Buffett Portfolio](http://www.bookdepository.com/The-Warren-Buffett-Portfolio-Robert-G-Hagstrom/9780471392644?ref=grid-view) by Robert G Hagstrom

The Brian McNiven book is fantastic! He provides terrific insight into
the real story behind company financial reports and when dividend
payments make sense to shareholders and when they don't. The Benjamin
Graham stuff is great also. Security Analysis was written after the
Depression but the comments about company and market behaviour describe
the tech meltdown of 2000 just as perfectly.
