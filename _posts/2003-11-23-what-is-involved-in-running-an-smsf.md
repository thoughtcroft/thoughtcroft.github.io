[The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia
Limited](http://www.asfa.asn.au/diy/rpm.cfm?page=main) has advice for
Trustees and a pretty good summary of the issues of running your own
fund.  Check it to see if it is really your style before taking the
plunge.

The also have some stats about small and DIY funds collected by APRA in
January 2003:

* 246,000 small funds
* 430,000 members or average 1.75 per fund
* $99 billion in assets or average $230,000 per fund
