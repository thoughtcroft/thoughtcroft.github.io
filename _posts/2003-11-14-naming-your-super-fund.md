answers the question of whether there are any limitations on the name of
your superfund and other questions. In summary:

* you can use any name you like
* it doesn't have to be unique
* there is no central register of names you can check anyway

We'll call ours "Bainsworld Superannuation Fund" just to get the
"bainsworld" monicker onto something official!
