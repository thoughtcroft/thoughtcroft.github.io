[Castle Corporate Services](http://www.castlecorp.com.au/site/suppc.htm)
is the company used by Taxpayers Australia to create Trust Deeds for an
SMSF. There are obviously many different companies doing this.

My conclusion from looking at quite a few of these is that you go with
the one that your adviser recommends even if that costs a little more.
If you incorrectly instruct the organisation drawing up the Trust Deed
you can only blame yourself and will (probably) not have any legal
comeback.

A few hundred dollars is insignificant in start-up costs and not an
important consideration in getting the SMSF underway.
