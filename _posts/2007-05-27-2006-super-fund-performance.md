I just noticed that I forgot to post last year's results for the
Bainsworld Superannuation Fund. Our *investment earnings rate for 2006
was 11.7%* which seems a little low given the way the Australian market
has been performing of late. Still we think that 2007 will be an
improvement on this.

Holdings include shares in:

* Alinta
* ARB Corporation
* BlueScope Steel
* ConnectEast Group
* JF Meridian Trust
* National Australia Bank
* OrotonGroup
* The Reject Shop
* Toll Holdings

We also have a number of managed investments and units in an unlisted
property trust. The standout performer in our portfolio is
The Reject Shop (ASX code TRS) which has been growing at a compound
annual growth rate of 100% - yes, it has doubled in value every year for
the four years we have held it!
