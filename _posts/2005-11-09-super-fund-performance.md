We have just completed our accounts for 2005 and I'm happy to report
that the **Bainsworld Superannuation Fund returned 17.5%** to its
members after tax and all expenses for the last year. Not too shabby
given that today's Australian Financial Review Quarterly Review of Funds
liftout lists the performance of the Top 20 super funds ranges from
10.7% to 13.9%.

It's steady as she goes for now although we are probably
holding a bit too much cash. It has been difficult to find good value
propositions in the market but all we have to do is be patient and
eventually, the market will cough up some opportunities.
