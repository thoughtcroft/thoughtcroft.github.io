[Corporate Network Ltd](http://www.incorporations.com.au/) is the
company that my accountant uses to set up companies (that's how Thought
Croft was created), trusts and super funds for his clients.  They charge
$325 for an SMSF set-up so given my accountant charges about $700 all up
his services come to about $375 for basically filling out the forms and
ensuring the correct filings are made to the ATO.

Looks like CNL is making their internal admin systems software available
to improve throughput (and lower their admin costs) although not quite
there yet.
