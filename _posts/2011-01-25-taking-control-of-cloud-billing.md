At Ninefold, we first started looking at the cloud market and its
possibilities in 2010.

We started with the technologies, understanding the
different players in the market and assessing the massive predictions
about the growth potential of cloud computing as touted by IDC, Gartner
and the like. It quickly became apparent to us that cloud computing
really could represent a "tipping point" for the IT industry and that,
as many people have predicted, it could completely transform the
delivery of computing.

John McCarthy put it this way:

> Computing may someday be organised as a public utility (and) the computer utility could become the basis of a new and important industry.

And this was in 1961! It has been a long time coming, but the evidence is showing
that cloud is starting to deliver on that promise. The question is: *who are the
customers?*

As we talked to people in the industry and started to
understand the user community, we quickly identified that the early
adopters of cloud computing were not enterprises with their massive
investment in existing IT infrastructure, running applications
architected around yesterday’s IT models and supported by in-house
staff. And while there has been a significant move to
Software-as-a-Service business applications delivered to SMB and larger
organisations - typified by the CRM category-killer, Salesforce.com –
this represents an evolutionary change in software delivery and not the
computing service revolution we sensed in the wind.

In fact, while many
people are fixated on the potential cost savings of cloud, early
adopters focused instead on agility and flexibility - on getting their
service to the market quickly and not being constrained by the need to
invest valuable capital into hardware and software assets housed in
expensive data centres.

Today’s IT start-ups, web entrepreneurs and
digital agencies are completely reliant on computing to run their
business. IT **is** the business for many of them. Their success relies on
being able to respond to the demands of the market quicker than their
competitors. They tap into social networks, run time-bounded campaigns,
and must be able to quickly scale their computing infrastructure upwards
and downwards in response to the elastic demands of a global
marketplace.

One of the biggest concerns these start-ups shared with us
was this: *how much will the cloud cost me?*

They don’t know what customer
demand will be next month. That’s why they move to the cloud, to
quickly respond to changes in demand. But that brings uncertainty about
the potential costs. And if they use a US based cloud, currency
fluctuations add additional uncertainty.

We get it.

So when we built Ninefold, we made sure that our customers had
the tools to manage their cloud usage.

You can organise your cloud resources into projects, the
same way that you organise your business. Those projects can be given a
budget and that budget can be allocated amongst the people working on
the project. If you set spend thresholds on a project or on the users in
the project, you and your colleagues will receive an email notification
when those thresholds have been reached - for example, an email when
your cloud resource consumption has reached 75% of your budget spend.

You can also see detailed current and historical usage charts in your
cloud dashboard so you know exactly which resources account for how much
of your spend.

It’s about giving you the information you need to make
sensible business decisions.

It’s about empowering our community to
maximise their use of cloud computing.

That’s the Ninefold way.
