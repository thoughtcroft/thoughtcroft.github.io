Unfortunately, and as predicted last year, **Bainsworld Superannuation
Fund had a negative return of -17.3% for 2008**.

Whilst not unexpected and probably reasonable given the carnage on the
share market, it is nonetheless disappointing.  However, we have no
intention of following the herd and selling out given that we feel the
companies we are invested in are good quality and their performance will
reflect that in the longer term.

But stay tuned for 2009 when I expect the result to be far worse...
