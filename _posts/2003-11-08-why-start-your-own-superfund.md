After watching the performance of our personal superannuation and
testing our investing know-how through an Investment Partnership with 10
other friends, Caroline and I are about to press the button on starting
an SMSF - a Self Managed Superannuation Fund.

We think the benefits of making our own investment decisions will be
enormous. For a start, the fees will be a LOT lower and that alone will
make a huge difference to the final value of our super funds. Currently
we pay a 4% entry fee and a 1.8% management fee. Based on our current
funds, an SMSF will take about 1% to run with no entry fees and this
will reduce as the fund grows as it is essentially fixed.

The ability to make sensible taxation decisions about dividends with
franking credits and to really exploit the power of compounding capital
gain will also prove to be a boon. As long as we make good investments
of course. I'll keep blogging with our progress and experiences so join
in with your own if you feel like it.
