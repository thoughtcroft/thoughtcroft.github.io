# DRAFT!

I'm a big fan of Chef and have [written about it's awesomeness
before]({% post_url 2013-03-22-whipping-up-awesome-with-chef %}). When I
was at Ninefold we looked at a few different solutions for managing
infrastructure as code. I recently decided to have a closer look at
[Ansible](http://ansible.com) which is very popular in the developer community.
